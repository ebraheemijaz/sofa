                    Maximum seating. Minimum space. It’s one of the main
                    benefits of a corner couch. They provide plenty of room to
                    seat multiple bums, but thanks to their modern L-shaped
                    design, they use the available space to its full potential.
                    Freeing up the rest of the floor for other things – such as
                    additional furniture, a decorative rug, your weekly Pilates
                    session…or tipsy dancing on Fridays. As such, they’re
                    suitable for pretty much any lounge – and at Sofa Club, we
                    cater to all. Small corner sofas. Large corner sofas.
                    Compact 2 seater corner sofas. Colossal chesterfield-style
                    corner sofas. You’ll find them all in our range. And as most
                    of our styles are modular, it’s possible to build the
                    perfect fit for your home – adding and configuring sections
                    to create a size that’s just right. Simply check the
                    dimensions under each product listing and ‘add to cart with
                    confidence.

                    Yes. All of our velvet and fabric corner sofas are
                    sectional. They arrive in a series of individual
                    easy-to-handle components. And once they reach their new
                    home, these components are simply slotted together – a bit
                    like Lego. We like to provide a stress-free sofa shopping
                    experience. And there’s nothing more stressful than getting
                    your new couch stuck in a doorframe or having to navigate a
                    windy staircase with an L-shaped 4 seater. When you shop
                    with us, those issues are a thing of the past.

                    The clue is in the name. Traditionally, corner sofas are
                    designed to be positioned in the corner of a room – against
                    two walls. That way, they provide plenty of seating without
                    taking over the space. But they don’t come with a rule book.
                    The beauty of interior design is that it’s subjective.
                    Follow the trends or don’t follow them. Conform to the norm
                    or don’t. It’s your home and you can style it however you
                    like. If you’re channelling Patrick Swayze (circa 1987) and
                    don’t want to put your ‘baby’ in the corner, then don’t do
                    it. Let your new L-shaped settee take centre stage and make
                    a statement in the middle of your lounge. On a practical
                    level, corner couches are a great way to separate spaces in
                    an open-plan living area. And as they’re modular, they can
                    be left- or right-handed and individual sections can be
                    fitted together – creating the perfect size and
                    configuration for whatever position you have in mind.
